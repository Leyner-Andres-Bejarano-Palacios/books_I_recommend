# 2004 - The Data Warehouse ETL Toolkit (Ralph Kimball)

I am a data engineer, I had the opportunity of taking data from transactional databases to data lakes and from there to datamarts with star schemas with fact tables and dim table. That is really formulatic but some best practices does not hurt you. This book is a great explanation of why we agreggate data the way we do it.
